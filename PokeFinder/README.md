Hi everyone,

I've made this "PokeFinder" that gives you the top 10 pokemons depending on the parameters.

This is done by extracting the pokemon's information from the json file (pokedex.json), inputting the data in a sql database and then querying the database for the specifics given by the end user.

The file "pokefinder.py" is the back end of it and can be used via the terminal.

While the file "Pokemon_GUI_BETA.py" is the GUI of the program.

This is my first end-to-end Python project which has involved extracting data, cleaning the data, organizing the data, querying the data via Python and making the GUI
